# Discord Server Configuration
GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=your_general_channel_id_here
GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id_here
VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=your_verified_role_id_here
ONBOARDING_ROLE_IDS=role_id_1,role_id_2,role_id_3

# Role Management Configuration

### 5. Discord Bot Setup

1. **Create Discord Application** at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **Create Bot** and get token
3. **Set OAuth Redirects** to match your domain
4. **Bot Permissions** needed:
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Embed Links
   - Manage Roles (for role assignments)

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:6000`

## üõ°Ô∏è Role Management System

The bot includes an automatic role management system that prevents unverified users from having access to committed member roles.

### How It Works
- **Unverified Role**: Users with this role are considered unverified
- **Committed Role**: A restricted role that unverified users cannot have
- **Automatic Enforcement**: The bot automatically removes the committed role from anyone with the unverified role
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Role changes are monitored in real-time to enforce restrictions

### Configuration
Set these environment variables to configure role names:
```env
UNVERIFIED_ROLE_NAME=Unverified
COMMITTED_ROLE_NAME=Committed
```

### Admin Commands for Role Management
- `/remove_restricted_roles` - Bulk remove committed role from all unverified users

## üéÆ Discord Commands

### User Commands
- `/balance` - Check your current point balance
- `/daily` - Claim your daily 85 point reward
- `/birthday <month> <day>` - Set your birthday (earn 50 points)
- `/leaderboard` - View top 10 users by balance
- `/achievements` - View your earned achievements
- `/qrcode` - Get your unique QR code (requires purchase)

### Admin Commands
- `/give_all <amount>` - Give points to all users
- `/emoji_system` - View emoji reward system information
- `/remove_restricted_roles` - Remove committed role from unverified users

## üåê Web Features

### User Features
- **Dashboard**: View balance, points earned, and purchases
- **Shop**: Browse and purchase products
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Discord Integration**: Login with Discord OAuth

## üé® Customization

### Theming
The application uses ASU colors but can be customized in `templates/base.html`:
```css
:root {
    --asu-maroon: #8C1D40;
    --asu-gold: #FFC627;
    --dark-bg: #1a1a1a;
    --dark-card: #2d2d2d;
}
```

### Point Values
Easily adjust point rewards in the environment variables:
```env
DAILY_ENGAGEMENT_POINTS=25
CAMPUS_PICTURE_POINTS=100
ENROLLMENT_DEPOSIT_POINTS=500
BIRTHDAY_SETUP_POINTS=50
```

- Product categories and filtering
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app integration
- Multi-server support

## üìã TODO - Next Development Cycle

### üîß Database Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] **Remove deprecated `models.py` file** - All models have been moved to `shared.py`, the legacy file should be deleted
- [ ] **Database migration to PostgreSQL** - Current SQLite setup needs upgrade for production scalability  
- [ ] **Automated balance consistency monitoring** - Currently runs on startup but could benefit from periodic health checks
- [ ] **Clean up image path inconsistencies** - Some products still have `/static/uploads/` prefixes that need ongoing monitoring
- [ ] **Review download token expiration logic** - 30-day expiration may need adjustment based on usage patterns

### üê≥ Docker & Deployment Improvements  
- [ ] **Implement proper user mapping** - Currently using root container approach, should migrate to proper UID/GID mapping
- [ ] **Automate backup retention policy** - `deploy.sh` creates timestamped backups but no cleanup mechanism
- [ ] **Container health checks** - Add proper Docker health check endpoints beyond basic connectivity tests
- [ ] **Permission persistence testing** - Ensure file permissions survive container restarts and updates
- [ ] **Multi-stage Docker build optimization** - Current Dockerfile could be optimized for smaller image size

### üßπ Code Cleanup & Refactoring
- [ ] **Requirements.txt cleanup** - Remove all commented packages and unused dependencies 
- [ ] **Consolidate startup checks** - Multiple permission/database checks in `main.py` could be modularized
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded paths** - Several scripts have hardcoded `/app/` paths that should be configurable
- [ ] **Centralize file upload logic** - Upload handling is scattered across multiple routes
- [ ] **Abstract permission management** - File permission logic is duplicated in `deploy.sh` and `main.py`

### üóÇÔ∏è File System Organization
- [ ] **Implement upload file cleanup job** - No mechanism for cleaning old/unused uploaded files
- [ ] **Standardize directory structure** - Mix of `uploads/` and `static/uploads/` directories needs consolidation
- [ ] **Add file size monitoring** - No alerts for when upload directories grow too large
- [ ] **Create staging environment** - All testing currently done on production data

### üö¶ Testing & Monitoring
- [ ] **Expand `test_bot_connection.py`** - Current test is basic, needs comprehensive Discord API testing
- [ ] **Add database integrity checks** - Beyond balance consistency, need referential integrity validation
- [ ] **Container resource monitoring** - No monitoring of memory/CPU usage within containers
- [ ] **Implement logging rotation** - Application logs could grow indefinitely
- [ ] **Add performance benchmarking** - No baseline metrics for response times or throughput

### üîê Security & Compliance  
- [ ] **Audit file permissions strategy** - Current 777/666 permissions are overly permissive
- [ ] **Review Discord token security** - Ensure proper token rotation procedures are documented
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** - No protection against API abuse on web endpoints
- [ ] **Add input validation audit** - File upload and form inputs need security review
- [ ] **Environment variable validation** - Missing .env variables fail silently

### üìä Data Management
- [ ] **Implement data export functionality** - No easy way to export user/purchase data
- [ ] **Add database schema versioning** - Current migrations lack proper version control
- [ ] **Create data anonymization scripts** - For GDPR compliance and testing
- [ ] **Establish backup verification process** - Backups created but never tested for restoration
- [ ] **Plan for data archival** - Old purchases and inactive users should be archived

### üéØ Priority Items (Next Sprint)
1. **Remove deprecated `models.py`** (Low risk, quick win)
2. **Clean up `requirements.txt`** (Reduces Docker build time)  
3. **Consolidate upload directories** (Fixes user confusion)
4. **Add container health checks** (Production stability)
5. **Implement proper Docker user mapping** (Security improvement)

### üí° Notes for Maintainers
- Many tasks marked with üîß in startup logs indicate technical debt
- `deploy.sh` script contains significant deployment logic that should be CI/CD automated
- Permission fixes appear in multiple places indicating a systematic issue
- Testing currently requires manual setup - automation needed
